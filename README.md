# Optimal Strategies for New Recruit using Linear Programming

Optimal combination of choices that maximise, minimise or equalise payoff for individual parties in the New Recruit problem can be estimated quantitatively using an Optimisation Model formulation. This can be especially useful for selecting options from distributive and integrative preference with incongruent payoffs. More concretely, (Mixed Integer) Linear Programming may be used to estimate payoffs with and without fixed constraints such as reservation values for co-operative and competitive scenarios with a objective function that maximises value creation.

The results from applying an optimisation model in the New Recruit problem indicate that the most co-operative (value-creation) scenario would result in the recruiter and candidate each receiving 6,600 points. On the other hand, minimum co-operation results in a 18,000 point difference with the candidate and recruiter receiving 12,000 and -6,000 points respectively.
